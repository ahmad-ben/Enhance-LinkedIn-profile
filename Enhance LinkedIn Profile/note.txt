How To Writ A Good LinkedIn About Section:
  Key Pointes The About Section Should Have:
    Customization: 
      There’s no one-size-fits-all LinkedIn summary. 
      It varies for job seekers, professionals, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders.
    Objective: 
      A good LinkedIn summary should compel your target audience to reach out to you.
    Common themes: 
      After analyzing many LinkedIn profiles.
        Common successful practices are incorporated into summary templates, such as: 
          Stating experience, achievements, and using metrics.
    Structure: 
      For job seekers: 
        Intro:
          Start with an introduction of your experience. 
          Intro line that tells the reader: 
            What field you're in.
            How many years of experience you have.
            The specific value you have brought to other companies. 
          Template With Example:
            Template:
              [Compelling Action Word] [Insert Job Title Keyword] with X+ years of experience in 
              [Insert Field / Job Title]. I help companies do 
              [Insert Pitch Or Value Proposition With Metrics Or Social Proof].
            Example:
              Innovative Product Marketing Manager with 7+ years of experience in B2B Marketing.
              I help companies identify high potential leads 
              and am responsible for US$ 121M in acquisition revenue (+78% YoY)*.
          Two notes:
            If you're a student: 
              Focus on your internships and extracurricular and make sure to include metrics. 
              Example:
                It's better to write:
                  "my presentation scored 24% higher than the class average".
                Instead of:
                  "I led a team presentation".
            Avoid using fluffy buzzwords, like "innovative".
              You will have the chance to proof that in the next section, case study bullet points.
        Provide bullet points showcasing specific case studies. 
          Three specific examples that best showcase your existing skill set.
            How they will be a great match for the role that you're hoping to land. 
            The structure here will be similar to the bullet point structure found in your resume.

        Conclude with what excites you professionally. 
          Without explicitly stating you’re looking for opportunities.
          Example:
            "I love applying my B2B LeadGen experience
            to help tech companies reach high growth SMBs to further scale their businesses." 
    Others:
      keep summaries within LinkedIn’s character limits.
      Use relevant keywords. 
        To embed the right keywords in your LinkedIn summary: 
          Find a role you're interested in. 
          Paste the entire LinkedIn job description in a Word document. 
          Do this 19 more times until you have 20 total. 
          Paste those 20 job descriptions in a word cloud generator, link for a free one:

          Pick the top five keywords into your LinkedIn summary.           
      Use formatting and emojis sparingly, the following website can help:

      Mention personal interests to create connection. 
        Add some small detail of it.
        Interests like:
          food, travel, family, sports, hobbies, and learning.
        Template:
          General Interest #1 (Specific Detail), General Interest #2 (Specific Detail), 
          General Interest #3 (Specific Detail), General Interest #4 (Specific Detail).
        Example:
          I'm planning to add Travel, Sports, Reading, and Learning to my interests:
          Interests: 
            Traveling (Currently planning a trip to Rabat – recommendations welcome!). 
            Reading (Currently reading Eat A Peach by David Chang). 
            Podcasts (my daily Go To's are Up First, The Tim Ferriss Show).
            the New York Football Giants.
      Use tools like the Hemingway app to refine readability and correctness.
