How To Writ A Good LinkedIn About Section:
  Key Pointes The About Section Should Have:
    Customization: 
      There’s no one-size-fits-all LinkedIn summary. 
      It varies for job seekers, professionals, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders.
    Objective: 
      A good LinkedIn summary should compel your target audience to reach out to you.
    Common themes: 
      After analyzing many LinkedIn profiles.
        Common successful practices are incorporated into summary templates, such as: 
          Stating experience, achievements, and using metrics.
    Structure: 
      For job seekers: 
        Intro:
          Start with an introduction of your experience. 
          Intro line that tells the reader: 
            What field you're in.
            How many years of experience you have.
            The specific value you have brought to other companies. 
          Template With Example:
            Template:
              [Compelling Action Word] [Insert Job Title Keyword] with X+ years of experience in 
              [Insert Field / Job Title]. I help companies do 
              [Insert Pitch Or Value Proposition With Metrics Or Social Proof].
            Example:
              Innovative Product Marketing Manager with 7+ years of experience in B2B Marketing.
              I help companies identify high potential leads 
              and am responsible for US$ 121M in acquisition revenue (+78% YoY).
          Two notes:
            If you're a student: 
              Focus on your internships and extracurricular and make sure to include metrics. 
              Example:
                It's better to write:
                  "my presentation scored 24% higher than the class average".
                Instead of:
                  "I led a team presentation".
            Avoid using fluffy buzzwords, like "innovative".
              You will have the chance to proof that in the next section, case study bullet points.
        Provide bullet points showcasing specific case studies. 
          Three specific examples that best showcase your existing skill set.
            How they will be a great match for the role that you're hoping to land. 
            The structure here will be similar to the bullet point structure found in your resume.

        Conclude with what excites you professionally. 
          Without explicitly stating you’re looking for opportunities.
          Example:
            "I love applying my B2B LeadGen experience
            to help tech companies reach high growth SMBs to further scale their businesses."
        End:
          Contact information with a proper phrase.
    Others:
      keep summaries within LinkedIn’s character limits.
      Use relevant keywords. 
        To embed the right keywords in your LinkedIn summary: 
          Find a role you're interested in. 
          Paste the entire LinkedIn job description in a Word document. 
          Do this 19 more times until you have 20 total. 
          You can:
            Paste those 20 job descriptions in a word cloud generator, link for a free one:
              https://www.freewordcloudgenerator.com
            Pick the top five keywords into your LinkedIn summary.           
          Or:
            Go to ChatGPT or Google Gemini and input this prompt:
              I am a job seeker applying to marketing manager positions. 
              Your task is to analyze the [X] job descriptions I will paste below
              and identify the top 10 keywords that appear by frequency. 
              Clearly show the number of times that keyword appears in the [X] job descriptions,
              i.e., show a numerical value next to the keyword. Here are the [X] job descriptions.
            Then paste the [X] job descriptions.
      Use formatting and emojis sparingly, the following website can help:
        https://www.textconverter.net/
      Mention personal interests to create connection. 
        Add some small detail of it.
        Interests like:
          food, travel, family, sports, hobbies, and learning.
        Template:
          General Interest #1 (Specific Detail), General Interest #2 (Specific Detail), 
          General Interest #3 (Specific Detail), General Interest #4 (Specific Detail).
        Example:
          I'm planning to add Travel, Sports, Reading, and Learning to my interests:
          Interests: 
            Traveling (Currently planning a trip to Rabat – recommendations welcome!). 
            Reading (Currently reading Eat A Peach by David Chang). 
            Podcasts (my daily Go To's are Up First, The Tim Ferriss Show).
            the New York Football Giants.
      Use tools like the Hemingway app to refine readability and correctness.

  Check for Profile Restrictions: 
    If LinkedIn restricts your profile: 
      You may need to know the email addresses of everyone you wish to connect with. 
    This typically happens after multiple low-quality connection requests. 
    Users can seek support through: 
      LinkedIn’s help site.
      Tweeting @LinkedInHelp for assistance.
  Upload your resume to LinkedIn: 
    Helps boost your visibility in searches because of the keywords in your resume.

    If recruiters search for specific keywords that are in your resume: 
      It increases the chances that your profile will show up in their search results.
  Highlighting Achievements: 
    Focus on the results you've achieved rather than just listing job duties. 
      That make your profile more attractive to recruiters, examples:
        Instead of:
          Managed a team of 10 employees.
        Say:
          Led a team of 10 employees to increase sales by 15%. 
          Developed marketing campaigns that resulted in a 25% increase in website traffic. 
          Saved the company $10,000 by implementing a new cost-saving measure. 
    When a recruiter looks at your LinkedIn profile. 
      Give them a reason to stop and read. 
    Recruiters want to see the following: 
      What you can do, what you’ve accomplished, and how you can help them achieve their goals. 
    Highlighting the impact of your actions, showcases your skills and potential: 
      Your past performance signals your future results and how you can help them.

        You can do this to any text easily with a tool of AI and the following prompt:
          "Correct any typos and grammatical errors in the following text."
      Maintaining a respectful online presence.
  Communication Settings: 
    Make sure your settings allow recruiters to message you directly to maximize job opportunities.
  Master Keywords: 
    Identify relevant keywords from job descriptions and include them 9-10 times in your profile. 
    The steps of doing this are:
      Rely on the method starting form the line *60*.
      Pick the top 3 relevant keywords, include them in the following frequency: 
        Headline -1 time-.
        About section -2/3 times-.
        Experience -3/5 times-.
        Skills -1 time-.
    Adopt the two-part headline formula that consists of:
      Part one: a keyword-filled overview.
      Part two: value illustration with results.
      Example: 
        The keywords: 
          Marketing, Product, Advertising.
        The Headline: 
          Product Marketing | Digital Advertising | 
          Helping small businesses 2x their return on ad spend.
  Write Keyword-Driven Headlines: 
    Use a two-part formula that includes relevant keywords and measurable results. 
      That can boost your search ranking.
  Steal with Pride: 
    Find and emulate optimized profiles of people at companies you want to work for.
      Then improve your own 😉.
    Steps:
      Go To LinkedIn homepage. 
      Click into the search bar and hit enter to perform an empty search.
      Then, click: 
        "Posts" 
        "All filters" 
        under "Author Company" input the companies you want to apply.
        Click "Show results" 
      Now have a list of active LinkedIn users who put real effort into optimizing their profiles. 
        They all work for companies you are interested in. 
      Go through and pick five profiles, many of them use the two-part headline formula. 
      And now you have a reference to these real and relevant examples when writing your headline.
  Write an Effective -About- Section: 
    Use a template to: 
      Highlight achievements.
      Metrics.
      Signal openness to new opportunities subtly.
  Get Skills Endorsed: 
    Ensure your skills are up-to-date and endorsed by professionals in your industry. 
      Recruiters often filter by skills.
    To identify the most important skills recruiters search for, you can use the following prompt:
      "I am a job seeker applying for marketing manager roles. 
      I will share five job openings I’m interested in below, 
      and your task is to identify the top 10 most relevant skills 
      based on the descriptions of those roles. 
      Clearly show how frequently each skill appears in the five job descriptions, 
      i.e., show a numerical value next to the skill. Here are the five job descriptions."
    Ideally, the endorsements should come from people who work in similar industries or roles. 
      Since their endorsement will carry more weight.
    Bonus tip: 
      If you endorse your colleagues’ skills, they may return the favor and endorse yours.
    Bonus info:
      linkedin's search algorithm will only factor in a skill if it has at least one endorsement.
