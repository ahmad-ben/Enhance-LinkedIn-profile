      "I am a job seeker applying for marketing manager roles. 
      I will share five job openings Iâ€™m interested in below, 
      and your task is to identify the top 10 most relevant skills 
      based on the descriptions of those roles. 
      Clearly show how frequently each skill appears in the five job descriptions, 
      i.e., show a numerical value next to the skill. Here are the five job descriptions."
